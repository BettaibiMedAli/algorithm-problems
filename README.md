Welcome to my repository where I practice solving algorithmic problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) using **Java**. This repository serves as a personal space for improving problem-solving skills, understanding data structures, and mastering algorithms.

The problems are categorized based on the type of data structure or algorithm being used, such as **Arrays**, **Strings**, **Linked Lists**, **Dynamic Programming**, etc.


## Languages Used

- **Java**: All solutions are implemented using Java.


## Why Java?

Java is a widely-used language that provides strong object-oriented principles and a robust set of libraries, making it great for solving competitive programming problems. It’s also the language I am most comfortable with for solving LeetCode problems.


## Problems Solved

I’m continuously adding more problems as I solve them. Here's a breakdown of the problem categories I'm focusing on:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Hashmaps
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

## Contribution

Feel free to explore the solutions and suggest improvements or optimizations. Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to share alternative solutions or new insights.
Happy coding!
